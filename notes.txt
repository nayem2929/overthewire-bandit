## File Naming Quirks:

- When a filename starts with a dash (`-`), it can be interpreted as a command-line option.
  To correctly reference such a file, use `./-filename` (e.g., `cat ./-file_with_dash`).

## Finding the right file with parameters:

- 'find .' recursively scans through all the folders and sub-folders in a directory.
- 'find' can be used with '-type f' to look for normal files and 'size -***c' to look for a size.
- 'find' can also be used with 'ls -l' to list permissions and other details.
- '-user USERNAME' and 'group GROUPNAME' options can be used to find by owners.

## 2>/dev/null: 

2 controls the stderr stream, '>' redirects them into /dev/null which is a bit discard bin. Useful for ignoring error 
messages

## Unzipping zip files:

While unzipping files compressed using different compression systems, identify the file type and use appropriate 
unzippers. Remember that zcat and bzcat's default output is standard output aka the terminal, whereas tar's default is 
the destination file.
